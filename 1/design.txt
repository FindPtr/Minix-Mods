# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a simple shell for minix that performs most file descriptor redirection operations.

# Available resources

# Design
Begin in a ready state. Upon receiving a newline character...
Parse input with lex for syntactical soundness. (Reset shell if there are grammar errors.)
   Lex (dlex.l) will create an array of indices called cmds whose entries point to the beginning of commands
   It will also include negative numbers indicating various operator sigils or the end of the line.
Parse again to figure out where phrases begin and end.
Iterate through phrases, setting up pipes and executing various commands.
Return to a ready state.

# Testing
Test string: ls | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat > output
